When used within a greedy cutset algorithm, our scores effectively protect against overfitting and yield a fast and almost hyper-parameter-free structure learner, distinguishing it from previous approaches.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Structure Scores for Probabilistic Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1667606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667606400,"objectID":"8567874ca6b4810035227cb46a9dc722","permalink":"https://yangyang-pro.github.io/publication/master-thesis/","publishdate":"2022-11-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/master-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Generalized Bayesian Network Classifiers","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rMay 2023\n🏫 I will be in Ljubljana 🇸🇮 to attend the European Summer School on Artificial Intelligence (ESSAI) from 24 - 28 July 2023.
