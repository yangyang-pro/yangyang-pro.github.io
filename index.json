Current and future developments of both probabilistic classification and graphical model learning can directly enhance our framework, which is flexible and provably optimal.","tags":[],"title":"Probabilistic Multi-Dimensional Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Yang","Gennaro Gala","Robert Peharz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1681344000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681344000,"objectID":"34512041a4d72246347b87215572490c","permalink":"https://yangyang-pro.github.io/publication/bayesian-scores-pc/","publishdate":"2023-04-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bayesian-scores-pc/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we develop Bayesian structure scores for deterministic PCs, i.e., the structure likelihood with parameters marginalized out, which are well known as rigorous objectives for structure learning in probabilistic graphical models. When used within a greedy cutset algorithm, our scores effectively protect against overfitting and yield a fast and almost hyper-parameter-free structure learner, distinguishing it from previous approaches.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Structure Scores for Probabilistic Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1667606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667606400,"objectID":"8567874ca6b4810035227cb46a9dc722","permalink":"https://yangyang-pro.github.io/publication/master-thesis/","publishdate":"2022-11-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/master-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Generalized Bayesian Network Classifiers","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rMay 2023\n🏫 I will be in Ljubljana 🇸🇮 to attend the European Summer School on Artificial Intelligence (ESSAI) from 24 - 28 July 2023.
